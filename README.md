🧩 Algorithm Practice Exercises

Welcome to my repository for practicing algorithms! Here, I’ll be uploading exercises to improve my problem-solving skills, strengthen my understanding of algorithms, and explore different techniques.

📂 Structure of the Repository
• Exercises are written in TypeScript for type safety and modern JavaScript features.

🛠️ Technologies Used
• TypeScript: The primary language for implementing the algorithms.
• Node.js: To execute the scripts locally.
• Testing Framework (optional): Tests for validating the implementations might be included using frameworks like Jest.

🚀 How to Use 1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/algorithm-practice.git

    2.	Navigate to the folder:

cd algorithm-practice

    3.	Install dependencies (if applicable):

npm install

    4.	Run an example:

npx ts-node path/to/example.ts

✨ Goals
• Gain deeper insights into core algorithmic concepts.
• Write clean, efficient, and well-documented code.
• Experiment with different problem-solving strategies.

Feel free to fork the repository, contribute, or suggest improvements!
